# ROBO-CAR-USING-ARDUINO
Autonomous Robo Car built with Arduino, servo, and ultrasonic sensors. Programmed microcontroller logic for obstacle detection and real-time navigation. Showcases skills in embedded systems and hardware-software interfacing.

This project details the development of a fully autonomous mobile robot using an Arduino Uno, designed to navigate environments by detecting and avoiding obstacles in real-time.

🌟 Project Highlights
Autonomous Navigation: Implements logic for continuous, obstacle-free movement.
Sensor Integration: Successfully interfaces an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with a servo motor for a 180-degree field of view scanning.
Embedded Systems Proficiency: Developed and tested embedded circuits and microcontroller C++ logic.
Hardware-Software Interfacing: Used a motor driver (L298N or similar) to manage power distribution and direction control for DC motors based on sensor input.
